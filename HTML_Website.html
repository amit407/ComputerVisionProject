<h3 align="left"> Introduction </h3>
<p align="justify">
    Isn't it weird that there are 15 different types of plug-socket in the world?<br> 
    In israel we use type H, in Italy and Chile they use type L.<br>
    Some countries suffer from multiple sockets types. for example, the maldives uses <b>6</b> types of sockets.<br>
    This problem is not going to be solved anytime soon. the IEC (International Elctrotechnical commission) created a universal socket - type N.<br>
    The intention was that the whole world would adapt the new socket, and all the countries would have the same socket's type.<br>  
    but to change the whole Electrical infrastructure of a country costs billions of dollars, so the world did not cooperate.<br><br>
    Since the problem of the multiple plugs is too deeply rooted, we decided to develop an application that recognizes sockets types.<br><br> 
    Our main goal was to develop an application that receives an image of a plug, analyzes the objects(number and shape of the holes on the plug)<br>
    and returns the type of the plug according to the properties detected on the plug.<br>

<h3 align="left"> Approach and Method</h3>
<p align="justify">
    In the main window of the application, the user can upload an image of a socket.<br>
    After uploading the image and pressing on "UPLOAD IMAGE", the application will activate the python program with the image.<br>
    All of our code is written in Python. The only libraries we used are cv2, numpy and math.<br>
    For the user interface we used tkinter.<br><br>
    The main steps: <br>
    1. resize the image. <br>
    2. recognize the object (the socket) and blank the wall behind.<br>
    3. find a threshold that marks the holes of the socket and erases noises on the sockets (such as shading etc).<br>
    4. for each hole detected, crop the hole from the original image.<br>
    5. for each cropped hole classify whether it is a circle or a rectangle.<br>
    6. given the set of circles and rectangles of one socket, find the relations between the holes and classify the type of the socket.<br><br>
    Now we will discuss on the main steps: <br><br>
    <u>Step 1 - Resize the image:</u><br>
    In order to normalize values such as radius, distances etc. between different images we resized all the images to be the same size.<br><br>
    <u>Step 2 - Recognize the object(the socket):</u><br>
    Create a binary image using "cv2.threshold()" to find the bright areas in the image.<br>
    Find the biggest polygon in the binary image.<br>
    Check the angles of the biggest polygon found to see if its angles not too sharp(less than 52 degree), if it is, lower the threshold, and try to find a polygon again.<br>
    It was needed to check the angles because we have encountered cases where the detected polygon passed between crucial parts of the socket. <br>
    So to not miss any information we had to try and find another polygon. <br><br>

    <u>Step 3 - Find a threshold:</u><br>
    We used the function "cv2.threshold()" to convert our grayscale image to a binary image. <br>
    We wanted to separate the black holes of the socket from the rest of the image. <br>
    So we had to find the right threshold that would mark only the holes as white spots, <br>
    and would refer to all the other image as a black background. <br>
    The threshold needed to be very accurate, not too big so it will not include shadows and unwanted black marks as holes, <br> 
    and not too small so the black holes of the socket will still be painted in white. <br>
    Also, different images needed different thresholds. so the threshold is individual per image. <br> 
    For these reasons we used a while loop that decreases the threshold in each loop until we get a list of 2 or 3 contours - the number of holes of a sockets. <br>
    To find the contours We used the function "cv2.findContours()" that returns a list of contours in the image. <br><br>

    <u>Step 4 - Crop the hole:</u><br>
    We got to a conclusion that to best classify each hole(as a circle or a rectangle), we had to look at it as the main object of the image.<br>
    Therefore, we used "cv2.approxPolyDP()" to get a polygon of each contour so we could crop the original image according to the x and y coordinates of each polygon.<br>
    We cropped the holes from the original image (and not from the binary image from previous step 3) <br>
    because we wanted the original and most accurate shape of the holes without the "cv2.threshold()" function damaging and affecting them. <br>
    After cropping the holes to one image per hole, we threshold each image with a more allowing threshold so that we get an accurate shape for each hole.<br><br>
    <u>Step 5 - Classify - circle or rectangle:</u><br>
    For each image of a single hole we used "cv2.approxPolyDP()" function that returns a polygon of the contour in the image.<br>
    The length of the polygon(number of points in the polygon) helped us determine <br>
    Whether it is a polygon of circle (the polygon has more than 8 points) or it is a rectangle (polygon has 2 to 5 points). <br><br>
    <u>Step 6 - Find relations between the holes:</u><br>
    After we found the shape for each hole, we now have the whole set of shapes of holes in a socket.<br>
    Some of the types of sockets are easy to detect because their set of shapes is unique. an example is socket type A.<br>
    Type A has 2 rectangles and 0 circles. and is the only type that has these set of shapes. <br>
    But some of the sets of shapes are not unique. <br>
    For an example, the set that consists of 3 circles appears in 4 different socket types.<br>
    So in order to classify these kind of cases we had to figure out the relations between the circles.<br>
    We created functions that calculate the radius of the circles, the relative locations of the circles, and function that calculates the angles<br>
    formed by connecting the 3 points (of the center of the circles) to a triangle.  <br>

<h3 align="left"> Results</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Out of the 15 types of sockets exist, we classified 12 of them, with a success rate of 84 precent.<br>
    The types that we did not deal with had the same holes shape as other plugs but had a difference at the surface of the socket. <br>
    In this project we preferred to focus on the differences between the holes of a socket.<br>
    Among the types we have dealt with, we checked 3 images per type. 36 images total.<br>
    30/36 images were not classified correct, because of shading that was too dark, or problem with the cropping step.<br>

<h3 align="left"> Conclusions</h3>
<p align="justify">
Our goal was to succeed to classify all the 13 types of sockets that have difference between the holes in them. <br>
However, when facing socket type K, we found it difficult to deal with the bottom hole that has a shape of a semi-circle.<br>
One of our goals was to deal with images that were taken from different angles. for that reason, some images of holes with circle shape<br>
that was taken from certain angles, classified by mistake as a semi-circle. <br>
We realized there is a trade-off between dealing with angles, and classifying semi-circles.<br> 
so we chose to deal with angles instead of recognizing the k type. As a result, instead of dealing with 13 types of sockets, we dealt with 12 types.<br>
This computer vision project was very educational and challenging to build.<br>
as we used classic techniques learned during the course to perform detection and recognition, getting satisfying results even with difficult images.<br>
Even though the application is good, there are still improvements to be made:<br>
<ul>
<li>Deal with socket types K, E and F.</li>   
<li>Improve the Cropping algorithm.</li> 
<li>Enable images of multiple sockets.</li>   
<li>Use of ANN and Deep Learning (not learned during the course).</li> 
</ul>
